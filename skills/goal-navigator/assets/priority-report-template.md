# Goal Navigation Report: [Project Name]

**Date**: [Current date]
**Milestone**: [Current milestone/phase]
**Prepared for**: [Team/Stakeholder name]

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences summarizing:
- Current project state (completion %, phase)
- Key insight or finding
- Primary recommendation]

**Example**:
> ThinkCanvas is 45% complete with a strong foundation (90%) but missing critical validation features (40%). The key insight is that import/export functionality is needed to enable user testing. Recommendation: Focus Week 1-2 on completing validation layer to prove core value proposition before investing in voice integration.

## Gap Analysis

### Foundation Gaps (Blocking Everything)

[List features in Foundation layer that are incomplete or missing]

| Feature | Current % | Impact if Missing | Priority |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| [Feature name] | [X%] | [What it blocks] | [M/S/C] |
| [Feature name] | [X%] | [What it blocks] | [M/S/C] |

**Critical Blockers**:
- ⚠️ [Feature X] (0% done) - Blocks [Y features]
- ⚠️ [Feature Z] (30% done) - Required for [use case]

**Example**:
> - ⚠️ **SQLite Persistence** (30% done) - Blocks multi-session testing, user research
> - ⚠️ **Authentication System** (0% done) - Blocks user-specific features, team collaboration

### Validation Gaps (Can't Prove Concept)

[List features needed to demonstrate core value and test with users]

| Feature | Current % | Value Proposition | Priority |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| [Feature name] | [X%] | [What it proves] | [M/S/C] |
| [Feature name] | [X%] | [What it proves] | [M/S/C] |

**What We Can't Validate Yet**:
- ❌ [Assumption 1] - Missing [feature X]
- ❌ [Assumption 2] - Missing [feature Y]

**Example**:
> - ❌ **"Visual PID > Text PID"** - Missing import/export to test with real users
> - ❌ **"AI manipulation adds value"** - Chat integration 50% done, can't test end-to-end

### Differentiation Gaps (Missing Magic)

[List unique features that set product apart from competitors]

| Feature | Current % | Competitive Advantage | Priority |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| [Feature name] | [X%] | [Why this differentiates] | [M/S/C] |
| [Feature name] | [X%] | [Why this differentiates] | [M/S/C] |

**Unique Value Not Yet Delivered**:
- 🎯 [Differentiator 1] - [Status and why it matters]
- 🎯 [Differentiator 2] - [Status and why it matters]

**Example**:
> - 🎯 **Voice-driven interface** (0% done) - Core differentiator, but can validate without it first
> - 🎯 **AI semantic zoom** (30% done) - Unique capability, partially working

### Polish Gaps (Enhancement Opportunities)

[List UX improvements and nice-to-have features]

| Feature | Current % | User Experience Impact | Priority |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|----------|
| [Feature name] | [X%] | [How it improves UX] | [M/S/C] |

**Assessment**: [Overall assessment of polish layer - is it appropriate for current phase?]

**Example**:
> **Assessment**: Polish layer is appropriately deferred (3% complete). Focus should remain on Foundation and Validation for MVP.

## Decision Points

### Should [Feature X] Be in [Milestone]?

- ✅ **Yes, if**: [Conditions where it's critical]
- ⏳ **Defer, if**: [Conditions where it can wait]
- **My Recommendation**: [Your assessment based on analysis]
- **Rationale**: [Why this recommendation - data, assumptions, trade-offs]

**Example**:

### Should Voice Integration Be in MVP?

- ✅ **Yes, if**:
  - Voice is the ONLY way to prove unique value proposition
  - User research shows strong demand (8+ of 10 users request it)
  - Technical spike confirms feasibility (latency <1s, accuracy >90%)

- ⏳ **Defer to v1.1, if**:
  - Chat-based commands can validate core value proposition
  - User research shows willingness to pay without voice
  - Technical spike reveals risks (high latency, low accuracy, complex integration)

- **My Recommendation**: ⏳ **Defer to v1.1** (4 weeks post-MVP launch)

- **Rationale**:
  - Core value is "visual PID > text PID", not specifically voice
  - Chat-based commands can prove concept with lower risk
  - Voice adds 2-week delay to MVP timeline
  - Can gather user feedback on chat version first, add voice if requested

## Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

[List 3-5 features that can be completed quickly but provide visible value]

1. **[Feature Name]** ([Time: X hours/days])
   - **Why Quick**: [Uses existing code, simple UI change, straightforward implementation]
   - **Why Valuable**: [What it unlocks, what it proves, what user value it provides]
   - **When to Build**: [Week X, or "anytime for momentum boost"]

**Example**:

1. **Export to Markdown** (1 day)
   - **Why Quick**: API logic already exists, just need UI button + file download
   - **Why Valuable**: Unblocks user testing (users can save work), proves import/export cycle
   - **When to Build**: Week 2, right after import is complete

2. **Wire Up MCP Tools to UI** (0.5 days)
   - **Why Quick**: Tools already exist in backend, just add buttons to UI
   - **Why Valuable**: Unlocks existing functionality, improves UX
   - **When to Build**: Week 1, quick morale boost

## Strategic Bets (High Impact, Higher Risk/Effort)

[List 2-3 features that are risky or hard but worth it for strategic reasons]

1. **[Feature Name]** ([Time: X weeks])
   - **Why Risky/Hard**: [Technical complexity, unproven tech, integration challenges]
   - **Why Worth It**: [Competitive advantage, core differentiator, strategic positioning]
   - **De-risking Plan**: [How to validate before full commitment]
   - **When to Build**: [After what validation]

**Example**:

1. **AI Semantic Zoom with Auto-Summarization** (2 weeks)
   - **Why Risky/Hard**: Complex AI prompt engineering, caching strategy, context window management
   - **Why Worth It**: Unique capability, no competitor has this, solves real user pain (information overload)
   - **De-risking Plan**: Prototype with 3 PIDs, test summarization quality, validate caching approach
   - **When to Build**: Week 3-4, after Validation layer proven

## Appendix: Sequencing Rationale

### Why This Order?

**Foundation → Validation → Differentiation Sequencing**:

1. **Week 1: Foundation** because [rationale - blocks everything, must be stable]
2. **Week 2: Validation** because [rationale - proves concept before differentiators]
3. **Week 3-4: Differentiation** because [rationale - builds on proven foundation]

### Dependency Graph

```
Foundation (Week 1):
├─ F-1: Persistence → Enables multi-session testing
│  └─ Blocks: V-3 (user research), D-1 (voice history)
│
└─ F-2: Import → Enables user testing
   └─ Enables: V-1 (visualization), V-2 (export)

Validation (Week 2):
├─ V-1: Visualization → Proves visual > text
│  └─ Depends on: F-1 (data), F-2 (import)
│
└─ V-2: Export → Completes import/export cycle
   └─ Depends on: F-2 (import format), V-1 (what to export)

Differentiation (Week 3-4):
├─ D-1: Voice → Core differentiator
│  └─ Depends on: V-1 (what to control), V-2 (export results)
│
└─ D-2: Semantic Zoom → Unique intelligence
   └─ Depends on: V-1 (visualization), F-1 (caching)
```

### Trade-Offs Considered

- **[Trade-off 1]**: Chose [option A] over [option B] because [rationale]
- **[Trade-off 2]**: Deferred [feature X] to prioritize [feature Y] because [rationale]

**Example**:
> - **Voice vs Chat**: Chose to build chat-based commands first because it validates core concept with lower risk, can add voice later if users request it
> - **Multiple Layouts vs Single Layout**: Prioritized single mind map layout to prove concept faster, can add Kanban/sticky notes in v1.1 based on feedback
