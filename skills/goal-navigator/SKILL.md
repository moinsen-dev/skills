# Goal Navigator

## Overview

Goal Navigator is a strategic consultant skill that helps teams navigate the gap between current project state and desired goals. Analyze PID/PRD documents alongside feature matrices or status reports, then provide concrete, prioritized recommendations on what to work on next.

This skill applies proven prioritization frameworks (MoSCoW, Dependency Mapping) to transform overwhelm into clarity, helping users make confident decisions about feature sequencing, scope management, and resource allocation.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users express:
- **Prioritization uncertainty**: "I have 50 features, where do I start?"
- **Scope overwhelm**: "Which features are MVP vs nice-to-have?"
- **Sequencing questions**: "What should we build first?"
- **Gap analysis needs**: "How far are we from our goals?"
- **Strategic decisions**: "Should we focus on X or Y?"
- **Resource allocation**: "What gives us the best ROI right now?"

**Trigger phrases**: "help me prioritize", "what should I work on next", "gap analysis", "feature roadmap", "MVP scope", "should I build X or Y first"

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Intake & Context Gathering

**1.1 Request Required Documents**

Ask the user to provide:
- **PID/PRD document** (vision, goals, success criteria, features)
- **Feature matrix or status report** (current implementation state, progress %)
- **Timeline context**: "What's your target milestone?" (MVP, beta, launch date)
- **Constraints**: Team size, available time, technical limitations

If documents are missing, guide the user:
```
"To provide the best recommendations, I need to understand your project state.

Could you share:
1. Your PID/PRD (vision, goals, key features)
2. Current implementation status (feature matrix, or just describe what's done/in-progress/planned)
3. Your timeline (when do you need MVP? next milestone?)

If you don't have a formal feature matrix, I can use the template in assets/feature-matrix-template.md to help you create one."
```

**1.2 Clarify Strategic Context**

Ask targeted questions to understand decision-making context:

**About Goals**:
- "What does 'success' look like at your next milestone?"
- "What's your definition of MVP for this project?"
- "Who needs to be convinced this works?" (Internal team? Users? Investors?)

**About Constraints**:
- "What's your biggest constraint?" (Time? Resources? Technical complexity?)
- "What assumptions are you least confident about?"
- "What keeps you up at night about this project?"

**About Priorities**:
- "If you could only ship ONE capability next week to prove the concept, what would it be?"
- "Are you optimizing for speed, quality, or learning?"
- "What would give you confidence you're on the right track?"

### Phase 2: Analysis

**2.1 Parse Project State**

Systematically extract from documents:

**From PID/PRD**:
- Core value proposition (what makes this unique?)
- Success criteria (what defines done?)
- Feature list (all planned capabilities)
- Technical constraints/requirements
- Target users/personas

**From Feature Matrix**:
- Completed features (%, status, notes)
- In-progress features (%, blockers)
- Planned features (priority, complexity)
- Phase 2+ features (deferred work)

**2.2 Identify Gaps**

Categorize features using **Dependency Mapping** framework (see `references/dependency-mapping.md`):

**Foundation Layer** (Must work first):
- Core data models, architecture decisions
- Essential infrastructure (database, API, auth)
- Blocks everything else if missing

**Validation Layer** (Proves concept):
- Minimum features to demonstrate value proposition
- Early user testing capabilities
- Assumption validation

**Differentiation Layer** (The unique magic):
- Features that set the product apart from competitors
- Core innovations, unique workflows
- The "why this vs alternatives" features

**Polish Layer** (Makes it delightful):
- UX improvements, animations, shortcuts
- Nice-to-have features that enhance experience
- Can be added anytime after validation

Identify **gaps** in each layer:
```markdown
## Gap Analysis

### Foundation Gaps (Blocking Everything)
- ⏳ SQLite Persistence (0% done) - Blocks multi-session testing
- ⏳ Authentication System (30% done) - Blocks user-specific features

### Validation Gaps (Can't Prove Concept)
- ⏳ Import from Markdown (0% done) - Can't test with real user data
- ✅ Basic visualization (60% done) - Partially working

### Differentiation Gaps (Missing Magic)
- ⏳ Voice integration (0% done) - Core differentiator missing
- ⏳ AI semantic zoom (40% done) - Unique feature incomplete

### Polish Gaps (Enhancement Opportunities)
- ⏳ Dark mode (0% done) - Nice-to-have
- ⏳ Keyboard shortcuts (0% done) - UX improvement
```

**2.3 Apply MoSCoW Framework**

Categorize features using **MoSCoW** (see `references/moscow-framework.md`):

**Must-Have** (Required for MVP):
- Essential to core value proposition
- Without these, product doesn't work or has no differentiation
- Example: For a "visual PID tool", must have visualization + AI manipulation

**Should-Have** (Important but not critical):
- Significantly enhances experience
- Valuable but product can launch without
- Example: Export to multiple formats (vs just one format)

**Could-Have** (Nice polish):
- Improves experience but low priority
- Can be added post-launch
- Example: Dark mode, animation effects

**Won't-Have** (Explicitly deferred):
- Out of scope for current milestone
- May revisit in future phases
- Example: Mobile app, collaboration features (for MVP)

Output categorization:
```markdown
## MoSCoW Analysis

**Must-Have (Critical for MVP)**:
1. Visual PID display (mind map layout)
2. AI chat integration
3. Basic persistence (save/load)
4. Import from markdown

**Should-Have (Important Enhancement)**:
1. Voice commands
2. Multiple diagram layouts
3. Export to multiple formats

**Could-Have (Nice Polish)**:
1. Dark mode
2. Keyboard shortcuts
3. Animations

**Won't-Have (Deferred to Phase 2)**:
1. Real-time collaboration
2. Mobile app
3. Plugin marketplace
```

**2.4 Risk Assessment**

Identify technical and strategic risks:

**Technical Risks**:
- Unproven technology (new API, untested library)
- Performance unknowns (can it scale? will it be fast enough?)
- Integration complexity (multiple systems must work together)
- Dependency on external services (API reliability, rate limits)

**Strategic Risks**:
- Unvalidated assumptions (will users actually use this?)
- Scope creep (too many features for timeline)
- Resource constraints (not enough time/people)
- Unclear requirements (ambiguous success criteria)

For each high-risk item, suggest **de-risking strategies**:
```markdown
## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items

**1. Voice API Integration (Technical Risk)**
- **Risk**: Untested technology, uncertain latency/accuracy
- **Impact**: Core differentiator, but 0% done
- **De-risking Strategy**:
  - Technical spike (1 day): Test OpenAI Whisper vs Google Speech-to-Text
  - Measure: latency, accuracy, cost
  - Decision: Choose provider or defer to Phase 2

**2. Users Prefer Visual > Text (Strategic Risk)**
- **Risk**: Core value proposition unvalidated
- **Impact**: Entire product concept depends on this
- **De-risking Strategy**:
  - Quick prototype: Import markdown → show visualization
  - User test with 5 people (1 week)
  - Measure: Do they prefer it? Would they pay?
```

### Phase 3: Recommendations

**3.1 Generate Priority Report**

Use the template in `assets/priority-report-template.md` to structure recommendations.

**Output Format**:

```markdown
# Goal Navigation Report: [Project Name]

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences: Current state, key insight, primary recommendation]

## Current State Overview
- Foundation Layer: [X%] [Status icon]
- Validation Layer: [X%] [Status icon]
- Differentiation Layer: [X%] [Status icon]
- Polish Layer: [X%] [Status icon]

**Key Insight**: [One sentence about the most important finding]

## Gap Analysis
[From Phase 2.2 - organized by dependency layer]

## MoSCoW Categorization
[From Phase 2.3 - organized by priority]

## Risk Assessment
[From Phase 2.4 - high-risk items with de-risking strategies]

## Recommended Action Plan

### [Timeframe 1]: [Focus Area]
**Goal**: [What you'll achieve by end of this phase]

1. ✅ [Feature/Task] ([Time estimate])
   - **Why**: [Rationale - unblocks what? proves what?]
   - **Impact**: [Expected outcome]

2. ⚠️ [Technical Spike/Research] ([Time estimate])
   - **Why**: [What risk this de-risks]
   - **Decision**: [What you'll know after completing]

[Repeat for 3-5 prioritized items]

### [Timeframe 2]: [Focus Area]
[Same structure]

### [Timeframe 3]: [Focus Area]
[Same structure]

## Decision Points

### Should [Feature X] Be in MVP?
- ✅ **Yes, if**: [Conditions where it's critical]
- ⏳ **Defer, if**: [Conditions where it can wait]
- **Recommendation**: [Your assessment based on analysis]
- **Rationale**: [Why this recommendation]

[Repeat for major scope/sequencing decisions]

## Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)
1. [Feature] - [Why it's quick] - [What it unlocks]
2. [Feature] - [Why it's quick] - [What it unlocks]

## Strategic Bets (High Impact, Higher Risk/Effort)
1. [Feature] - [Why risky/hard] - [Why worth it]
2. [Feature] - [Why risky/hard] - [Why worth it]

## Next Steps
1. [Immediate action]
2. [Follow-up after action 1]
3. [Iteration point]
```

**3.2 Sequencing Principles**

When recommending order of work, apply these principles:

**Foundation First**:
- Build core infrastructure before features that depend on it
- Example: Persistence before multi-session features

**Validation Early**:
- Prove core value proposition as soon as possible
- Example: Import + visualize before voice commands (proves visual > text)

**De-Risk Uncertainties**:
- Technical spikes for risky assumptions before committing to build
- Example: Performance test before scaling features

**Quick Wins for Momentum**:
- Include 1-2 quick wins in each phase
- Example: Wire up existing API to UI button (fast, visible impact)

**Unblock Parallel Work**:
- Prioritize work that enables others to work independently
- Example: API design document before frontend + backend implementation

**3.3 Provide Rationale**

For every recommendation, explain **why**:

**Good Rationale Examples**:
- "Persistence unblocks multi-session testing and user research"
- "Import proves 'visual > text' assumption with minimal effort"
- "Voice spike de-risks your core differentiator before committing 2 weeks"
- "Export to markdown is quick win (API exists, just add UI button)"

**Avoid Vague Rationale**:
- ❌ "This is important" (why is it important?)
- ❌ "Users will like this" (how do you know?)
- ✅ "This proves core value prop with 5-user test"

**3.4 Handle Uncertainty**

When you lack information to make confident recommendations:

**Option 1: Ask Clarifying Questions**
```
"I see 'voice integration' listed as MVP but it's 0% done and high-risk.

Before recommending whether to prioritize it, I need to understand:
1. Is voice the ONLY way to prove your unique value? Or can chat-based commands validate the concept first?
2. Have you tested any voice APIs? Do you know latency will be acceptable?
3. Would users pay for this without voice, or is voice make-or-break?

Could you help me understand your thinking here?"
```

**Option 2: Offer Conditional Recommendations**
```
"Recommendation depends on your risk tolerance:

**If you want to validate quickly (lower risk)**:
- Build chat-based commands first (3 days)
- Test with users
- Add voice only if they request it

**If voice is make-or-break (higher risk)**:
- Run 1-day technical spike first
- Test latency + accuracy
- Then commit to 1-week implementation
```

**Option 3: Suggest Discovery Work**
```
"I don't have enough information to confidently recommend priority.

Suggested discovery work (1-2 days):
1. Interview 5 potential users: Would they use this? Would they pay? Must-have features?
2. Competitive analysis: What do alternatives offer? What's your unique angle?
3. Technical spike: Test the riskiest assumption (voice? performance?)

After discovery, we'll have data to make a confident recommendation."
```

## Using Bundled Resources

### References

**`references/moscow-framework.md`**: Detailed explanation of Must/Should/Could/Won't prioritization methodology with examples and decision criteria.

**When to reference**: When applying MoSCoW categorization during Phase 2.3, or when explaining prioritization rationale.

**How to use**: Read the reference to understand categorization criteria, then apply to user's features. Quote relevant criteria when explaining "why" a feature is Must vs Should.

**`references/dependency-mapping.md`**: Framework for sequencing work based on dependencies (Foundation → Validation → Differentiation → Polish).

**When to reference**: When identifying gaps (Phase 2.2) or sequencing recommendations (Phase 3.2).

**How to use**: Read the reference to understand layer definitions, then categorize user's features by dependency layer. Use layer names when structuring gap analysis and action plans.

### Assets

**`assets/feature-matrix-template.md`**: Standardized template for tracking feature status, progress, and priorities.

**When to offer**: If user doesn't have a formal feature matrix or status report.

**How to use**:
```
"I notice you don't have a structured feature matrix. Would it help if I created one for you?

I can use the template in assets/feature-matrix-template.md to organize your features by:
- Status (Completed, In Progress, Planned, Deferred)
- Priority (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- Complexity (Days/Weeks/Months)
- Dependencies (what blocks this? what does this block?)

Would you like me to create this for your project?"
```

**`assets/priority-report-template.md`**: Output format for goal navigation reports with consistent structure.

**When to use**: Always use this template when generating Phase 3 recommendations.

**How to use**: Read the template, fill in each section based on analysis, customize for user's project context.

## Examples

### Example 1: Overwhelmed by Feature List

**User**: "I have 120 features planned for my app, I don't know where to start. Here's my feature list and PID."

**Response**:
```
Let me help you navigate this. First, a few questions to understand your context:

1. What's your definition of MVP? (First paying customer? Demo-ready? Beta launch?)
2. What's your timeline? (When do you need MVP?)
3. What's your biggest uncertainty? (Will users pay? Will it scale? Will the tech work?)

While you answer those, I'll analyze your feature list and PID to identify:
- Foundation features (must work first, block everything else)
- Validation features (prove your core value prop)
- Differentiation features (what makes you unique)
- Polish features (nice-to-have improvements)

I'll then provide a sequenced action plan with 3-5 quick wins to start and a recommended roadmap."
```

### Example 2: Scope Decision (MVP vs Phase 2)

**User**: "Should voice integration be in MVP? It's our differentiator but it's complex and we're behind schedule."

**Response**:
```
Let me help you think through this decision.

**Current State**: Voice is 0% done, high technical complexity, core differentiator

**Key Question**: Can you validate your value prop WITHOUT voice first?

**Analysis**:
- Your PID says "voice-powered visual thinking" is the unique value
- But the underlying value is "visual thinking > text documents"
- Voice is the *interface*, not the *value*

**De-risking Strategy**:
1. Build chat-based commands first (lower risk, faster)
2. Test with 5 users: Do they prefer visual manipulation?
3. Measure: Would they pay? Do they request voice?

**Recommendation**:
- ✅ If users love it and request voice → add voice to MVP
- ⏳ If users love it but don't request voice → defer to Phase 2
- ⚠️ If users don't prefer visual → pivot before investing in voice

**Timeline Impact**:
- Chat-based: 3 days
- Voice: 1 week (after chat proven)
- Risk reduced: Validate concept before committing to complex voice integration

Does this help clarify the decision?
```

### Example 3: Technical Risk

**User**: "We're building a React Flow canvas with potentially 500+ nodes. Not sure if it will perform well. Should we build on it or choose a different library?"

**Response**:
```
This is a foundational risk that should be resolved ASAP. Here's how:

**Technical Spike (2-3 hours)**:
1. Create synthetic PID with 500 nodes
2. Load into React Flow
3. Test zoom, pan, layout switching
4. Measure: FPS, rendering time, memory usage

**Decision Criteria**:
- ✅ If FPS > 30, rendering < 2s, memory < 500MB → Build on it
- ⚠️ If performance acceptable but borderline → Set node limits, optimize
- ❌ If unusable → Research alternatives (Cytoscape.js, D3.js, Canvas-based)

**Priority**: Do this spike THIS WEEK before building more features on React Flow.

**Why**: You're at 60% done with visualization. If React Flow doesn't scale, you need to know NOW before investing more effort.

**Time Investment**: 2-3 hours for spike vs weeks of wasted work if wrong choice.

Want me to help you structure this technical spike?
```

## Best Practices

### Do:
- ✅ Read all provided documents thoroughly before analyzing
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions when context is ambiguous
- ✅ Apply frameworks consistently (MoSCoW, Dependency Mapping)
- ✅ Provide concrete rationale for every recommendation
- ✅ Sequence work logically (Foundation → Validation → Differentiation)
- ✅ Identify risks and suggest de-risking strategies
- ✅ Balance quick wins with strategic bets
- ✅ Use templates for consistent output quality

### Don't:
- ❌ Make recommendations without understanding context
- ❌ Use vague rationale ("this is important", "users will like it")
- ❌ Ignore technical risks or unvalidated assumptions
- ❌ Recommend features without explaining sequencing
- ❌ Prioritize polish before foundation/validation
- ❌ Assume user's timeline, risk tolerance, or constraints
- ❌ Output generic advice - be specific to their project

## Iteration & Refinement

After providing initial recommendations:

**Check Alignment**:
```
"Does this plan feel right to you?

Are there any priorities I misunderstood, or constraints I didn't account for?"
```

**Refine Based on Feedback**:
- If user disagrees with categorization → ask why, understand their perspective
- If timeline is wrong → adjust sequencing
- If priorities shifted → re-run analysis with new context

**Validate Recommendations**:
```
"Before you start executing, let's validate the assumptions:

1. Does [Foundation Layer] accurately reflect what must work first?
2. Is [Week 1 Goal] achievable in your timeline?
3. Are there any blockers I didn't account for?

I can adjust the plan based on your feedback."
```

**Ongoing Partnership**:
- Offer to re-analyze after each milestone
- Adapt recommendations as project state changes
- Learn from what worked / didn't work

---

**Remember**: The goal is to transform overwhelm into clarity, helping users make confident decisions about what to build next. Provide data-driven, concrete, actionable recommendations with clear rationale.
